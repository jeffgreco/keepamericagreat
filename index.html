  </div>
  <!--   <p>stand in opposition against trump's vision of our country</p>

<p>If Donald Trump succeeds in enacting his tax plans, millions of well-off Americans will find themselves with some extra money in their refund checks -- money coming straight from the social services and public programs Trump pledges to shut down.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t think the answer is cutting up the social safety net, then pledge your Trump Tax Refund back to the communities that will suffer.</p>
